## version

### td and rtdlib/telegram-client

Version mapping

| telegram-client        | td          |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 0.*                    | [master@5587f10](https://github.com/tdlib/td/commit/5587f10eba5bc1ea44732970fbac5bd908680dc5)      |
| ~~1.3.*~~              | ~~1.3.*~~   |
| ~~1.4.*~~              | ~~1.4.*~~   |
| ~~1.5.*~~              | ~~1.5.*~~   |
| ~~1.6.*~~              | ~~1.6.*~~   |
| ~~1.7.*~~              | ~~1.7.*~~   |

The version `1.3`, `1.4`, `1.5`, `1.6`, `1.7` is outdated. the reason you can read

- [A new telegram client update](https://github.com/fewensa/telegram-client/issues/29)
- [UPDATE_APP_TO_LOGIN](https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/1758)

Therefore, if tdlib has not had a new release version, the telegram-client `1.x` version will no longer be maintained. Please use `0.x` and if you used `1.x` you can change your dependency to `0.x`.


### telegram-client and rtdlib

A fixed version is recommended, you can read [Comparison requirements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#comparison-requirements) about the fixed version.
Because of cargo's dependency mechanism, if you don't specify a specific version, it will be automatically upgraded, but there is usually a dependency between t and a, and the new version cannot be applied.
The current dependencies are as follows:


| telegram-client        | rtdlib      |
|------------------------|-------------|
| =0.7.2                 | =0.7.2      |
| ~~=1.3.7~~             | ~~=1.3.7~~  |
| ~~=1.4.6~~             | ~~=1.4.6~~  |
| ~~=1.5.5~~             | ~~=1.5.5~~  |
| ~~=1.6.6~~             | ~~=1.6.6~~  |
| ~~=1.7.0~~             | ~~=1.7.0~~  |
| ~~=1.7.1~~             | ~~=1.7.1~~  |


## Note

Note that you need [tdjson](https://github.com/tdlib/td) dylib file in your path for building and running your application. See also [rtdlib-sys](https://github.com/fewensa/rtdlib-sys) for more details.

## Examples


### block

```rust
fn main() {
  let api = Api::default();
  let mut client = Client::new(api.clone());
  let listener = client.listener();

  listener.on_receive(|(api, json)| {
    debug!("receive {}", json);
    Ok(())
  });

  client.daemon("telegram-rs");
}
```

### async

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let api = Api::rasync();

  let mut client = Client::new(api.api().clone());
  let listener = client.listener();

  // listener.on_update_authorization_state...

  client.start();

  let chat = api.get_chat(GetChat::builder().chat_id(1)).await;
  println!("{:#?}", chat);
}
```

## Event

Most of the events are from td, two events of particular concern.

### on_receive

This event is receive everything from td, returned data type is a json string.

### on_exception

When td returned json can not deserialize, or your event handler returned error. will be call is event.

a sample of event handler returned error

```rust
listener.on_proxy(|(api, pxy)| {
debug!("Proxy info => {:?}", pxy);
Err(TGError::new("some error"))
});
```
